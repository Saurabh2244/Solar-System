# Solar-System

I created my first website to provide information about the Solar System. The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, and Tailblocks. It offers a user-friendly experience, ensuring easy navigation and comprehension. Moreover, the site is fully responsive, allowing it to adapt flawlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
